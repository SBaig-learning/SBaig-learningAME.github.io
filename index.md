# Re-engaging Learners  
**A human-centered approach to student disengagement**

I’m a computer science teacher with a humanities background, and I’ve spent years watching a pattern repeat itself: many capable students slowly disconnect from learning—not because they lack intelligence or discipline, but because learning can start to feel cold, impersonal, and detached from life.

This site is a home for an ongoing inquiry: **How did we inherit an educational experience where knowledge often feels distant from the living human being trying to learn it?** And how might we reclaim meaning in a way that restores curiosity, agency, joy, and wonder—especially in technical and AI-shaped learning environments?

## What I’m exploring

- **Disengagement as a signal**  
  Not a character flaw or motivation problem, but a sign that the relationship between learner and knowledge has become strained.

- **The history of abstraction**  
  How knowledge moved from lived human contexts into systems, disciplines, standards, and impersonal forms—and what was gained and lost.

- **Reclaiming meaning without losing rigor**  
  How learning can become more alive by reconnecting ideas to the human questions, needs, and experiences from which they emerged.

- **Agency in the age of AI**  
  What it means to learn well when machines can generate information instantly, and why human judgment, care, and purpose matter more than ever.

## About

I am interested in how learning changes when students are invited to form a meaningful relationship with knowledge—when ideas are approached not only as information to master, but as human responses to real problems, curiosity, and care.

Rather than rejecting rigor or abstraction, I explore how learning can be re-grounded in **human agency, context, and participation**. I see this as a long-term project: tracing how we got here, and experimenting with ways forward that help learners feel more connected to what they study.

## Work With Me

I work with students, parents, and educators who sense that something important has gone missing in contemporary learning and want to approach education more thoughtfully.

**Ways we might work together:**
- **Student conversations** (orientation, agency, meaning—not tutoring, not therapy)
- **Parent consultations** (understanding disengagement, reframing, supportive next steps)
- **Educator & school conversations** (agency-centered learning, AI-era learning, historical framing)

**What this is not:**
- test prep or academic acceleration programs  
- productivity systems or “motivation hacks”  
- guarantees of specific outcomes  

If you’re seeking clarity, reconnection, and a more human relationship with learning, we may have something to explore together.
